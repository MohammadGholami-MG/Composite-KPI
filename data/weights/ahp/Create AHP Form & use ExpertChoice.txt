Guide to Create AHP Google Form for 5 KPIs

1.Create Form:
   - Go to forms.google.com, start new form.
   - Title: "Prioritizing Company KPIs".
   - Description: "Help us rank 5 KPIs (e.g., sales, margin) for a composite index. Takes ~10 min. Thanks!"

2.Section 1: Basic Info:
   - Q1: Name & Role (Short answer, e.g., "John, Sales Manager").
   - Q2: KPI Familiarity (Multiple choice: "Fully familiar", "Somewhat familiar", "Need explanation").

3.Section 2: KPI Definitions:
   - Q: Read KPI descriptions (Paragraph):
     - Net Sales: Total revenue after deductions.
     - Margin: Profit percentage from sales.
     - NPS: Customer loyalty score.
     - New Sales: % of sales from new products.
     - Refrigerator Share: % of sales from refrigerators.
     - Confirm: "I understand" (Multiple choice, required).
   - Optional: Text field for questions.

4.Section 3: Pairwise Comparisons:
   - 10 questions (Linear scale, 1-9: 1=Equal, 3=Slightly more important, 5=Moderately, 7=Very, 9=Extremely).
   - Example: "How much more important is Net Sales vs. Margin?" (1-9, with note: "E.g., choose 3 if Net Sales is 3x more important").
   - Pairs: 
     1. Net Sales vs. Margin
     2. Net Sales vs. NPS
     3. Net Sales vs. New Sales
     4. Net Sales vs. Refrigerator Share
     5. Margin vs. NPS
     6. Margin vs. New Sales
     7. Margin vs. Refrigerator Share
     8. NPS vs. New Sales
     9. NPS vs. Refrigerator Share
     10. New Sales vs. Refrigerator Share
   - Tip: Add example: "Choose 5 if one KPI is much more critical."

5.Section 4: Feedback (Optional):
   - Q: "Any comments on KPI priorities?" (Paragraph).
   - Optional: 1 control question (e.g., reverse pair like NPS vs. Net Sales) for consistency.

6.Settings:
   - Collect email addresses: On.
   - Responses to Google Sheets: On.
   - Show progress bar: On.
   - Randomize question order: Optional (reduce bias).

7.Test & Share:
   - Test with 1-2 managers (check clarity, ~10 min).
   - Share link via email/Teams, with reminder: "Takes 10 min, due in 2 days."

8.Analyze:
   - Export responses to CSV/Sheets.
   - Build 5x5 pairwise matrix (a_ji = 1/a_ij for reverse pairs).
   - Use AHP code to calculate weights and Consistency Ratio (CR < 0.1 ideal).

Tips:
- Keep questions clear, use examples.
- Use visuals (icons/stars) for scale.
- Collect from 3-5 managers, average weights.
- If too complex, try BWM (8 comparisons).
